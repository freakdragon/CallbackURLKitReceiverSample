# CallbackURLKitReceiverSample

This is an example of using CallbackURLKit(https://github.com/phimage/CallbackURLKit) when you need your own receiver and sender programs.

This is the receiver part of it. 

You can find the second part of example here:

The source of CallbackURLKit is here too because I had to change access to some functions to public.
